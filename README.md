## Built With

- **HTML5:** For the structure and semantic markup of the webpage.
- **CSS3:** For styling and layout, including flexbox and responsive design techniques.

## Challenges and Learnings

In this project, I focused on creating a clean, responsive layout using only HTML and CSS. I learned to implement responsive images effectively and enhanced my skills in CSS, particularly with flexbox. This project also gave me the opportunity to refine my understanding of design principles, such as visual hierarchy and balance.

## Installation and Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ionStici/skilled-elearning-landing-page.git
cd skilled-elearning-landing-page
live-server
```

The `index.html` and `styles.css` are the core files that structure the page.
